  The scheme interpreter was my final project for CS61A, the introductory
  course to programming (in Python/Scheme). In its essence, we wrote an
  interpreter for Scheme, a dialect of Lisp, in Python. Even though, at
  this point, I was very familiar with Python and how to organize my
  projects, the rather rigid structure we were given caused my partner,
  Michael, and I many a headache. There were also a few interesting
  algorithmic problems we had to complete in Scheme. All in all, this
  project demonstrated our budding mastery of Python.
