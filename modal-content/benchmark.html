  After I heard about the reknowned speed of Google's V8 JavaScript engine
  and had a glimpse of Cython, I became more and more interested in how
  Cython and JavaScript actually compared to a myriad of other
  languages. That, combined with my roommate Andrew's constant praise for
  Haskell and the fact that no benchmarks out there seemed to provide me
  the exact comparisons I wanted, inspired me to create a simple
  benchmarking suite to see for myself.

  <!-- insert graphs here -->
  Currently, results are pending. Here are some preliminary conclusions:
  <ol>
    <li>
      It would seem that, as predicted, JavaScript runs unimaginably fast -
      nearly as fast as compiled languages such as C and Java.
    </li>
    <li>
      Java, contrary to my beliefs, was also very nearly as fast as C, but
      with larger initial start-up times (due to starting of the JVM).
    </li>
    <li>
      Properly generated Cython can be as fast as both Java and C. Of
      course, this is expected because Cython compiles into C, but
      Cython-generated C files are upwards of 1,500 lines long, while
      normal C programs doing the same thing are much much less. Could this
      be the result of certain optimizations Cython performs for us
      automatically that we could not know?
    </li>
    <li>
      Compiled Haskell is still slower than Google's JavaScript, but
      significantly faster than most dynamically interpreted languages.
    </li>
    <li>
      Out of the dynamically interpreted languages (not including
      JavaScript), Ruby is now slightly faster than Python now, probably
      due to its new JIT compiler. Dynamically interpreted Haskell is
      god-awful slow. (TODO: test R, Matlab, Octave, Julia?)
    </li>
  </ol>

  NOTE: results above not mine, just a filler image of another's benchmark.
  I'm currently still working on getting more thorough benchmarks for myself.
