  For the second project in CS61C, we implemented a multi-starting-point
  parallel breadth-first search in Hadoop. The data set we worked with was
  non-trivial - for the second part, we analyzed a Hollywood actor data set
  and a Wikipedia link data set to find the shortest distance, given
  multiple starting points, to all other points in the graph. The Hollywood
  data set is estimated to have been around 2.8 GB, while the Wikipedia
  data set is estimated to have been around 10 GB.
