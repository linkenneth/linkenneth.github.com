  Lines of Action is a not-so-well-known board game, one which we had to
  create as our final project for CS61B, Berkeley's course on Java and data
  structures. In addition to creating an environment for the game, we also
  had to make AI that were at-least half-decent at the game. Learning about
  how AI works really interested me, and I look forward to creating more
  intricate AIs in the future that dynamically learn and improve.
