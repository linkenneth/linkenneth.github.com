  The Chain Reaction Hackathon was the first hackathon that Michael and I
  placed at - first place, in fact. Granted, we started early because this
  was a short hackathon and our main goal was to finish, we told the judges
  and gave up our first place position. Fortunately, they still allowed us
  to select a prize, for which we are very grateful.

  In its essence, our hack was a true chain reaction - a Rube Goldberg
  machine intertwining hardware and software, servers and servos. We wanted
  to add in as many random components as we could think of, which led us to
  adding all sorts of Twilio, Arduino, Android, and Node.js goodies. For a
  more detailed description of what exactly we did, take a look at the
  Github page for it.
