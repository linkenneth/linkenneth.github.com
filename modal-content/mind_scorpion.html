  Michael always loved brain-computer interfaces, but we never thought we'd
  be able to control something with our minds so fast.

  Alongside Preetum, David, and Stephen, our original project was centered
  around using the NeuroSky MindSet, an EEG set, to control remote control
  (RC) cars. We had a lot of issues with getting the bluetooth of the
  NeuroSky set up, and we were so frustrated to a point that we decided to
  give up on the original plan and make another hack - a Wii-remote
  controlled RC car that can track you down and sting you with its tail,
  which was equipped with a large camera capacitor. After some of Stephen's
  determination, we were actually able to get the NeuroSky set up as
  well. In the end, we had two RC cars, a slave car that would do whatever
  your mind bids, and a ruthless assassin-stinger car, determined to end
  you with shocks of several hundred volts - Mind and Scorpion.

  As the hackathon was hosted by LeapMotion, teams that placed were by an
  immense majority those who used LeapMotion products. Nevertheless, we
  were given "Best Hardware Hack". A month later, we received email from
  Texas Instruments asking us to host our project on their student
  repositories and possibly participate in the Analog Design Contest. We
  look forward to further enhancing these two cars, and personally, I look
  forward to working more with the NeuroSky.
