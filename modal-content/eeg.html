  For our final project in EE40, our introductory circuits class, we
  created an electroencephalogram - surprisingly similar to some of the
  things we already did for our MindScorpion hack. We designed our circuits
  in MultiSim, used UltiBoard to create the boards, and sent them to
  manufacturers to get printed. I learned that EEGs can actually distinctly
  pick up "look left" and "look right" movements, and I believe this will
  definitely be something we will be using in our next NeuroSky project.
