  The Big Hack of 2011 was the first hackathon at which I was able to plan,
  execute, and completely finish a project along with teammates. Our
  project, Thunder Ant, was a way to visualize data. More specifically, we
  took the sequence of integers and did the following:
  <ol>
    <li>Imagine a (Thunder) ant that knows how to count integers.</li>
    <li>For each integer, if the number is prime, turn left.</li>
    <li>Otherwise, go straight.</li>
  </ol>
  These three simple rules allow the ant to trace an absolutely incredible
  path in the two-dimensional plane, creating an almost fractal-esque image
  with both very dense neighborhoods and very sparse neighborhoods. If this
  same concept could be applied to other sequences, there may likely be
  other very interesting patterns.
