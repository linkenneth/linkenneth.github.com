  The Karaoke Song Voter was my project for my first hackathon. Using
  Python's bottle framework, we built a quick web application that allowed
  users to upvote various songs, democratizing the song selection process
  in gatherings such as karaokes. As this was my first ever individual
  project, I was admittedly pretty lost about ideas such as how a web
  server worked, how browsers worked, various protocols, and all the
  front-end development did. Nevertheless, trying to learn everything on
  the spot with friends was a great experience, and inspired me to complete
  future projects.
